### Designing synthetic DNA strand library 

The included Java scripts are used to generate the required library of short synthetic DNA strands (to be submitted for example to a DNA synthesis vendor) required to produce a desired final DNA nano shape comprised entirly of synthetic DNA (as opposed to viral-DNA-scaffoled assemblies [Rothemund, P. W. (2006). Folding DNA to create nanoscale shapes and patterns. Nature, 440(7082), 297.][1] 

A 100x100 nanometer square DNA lattice contains ~ 2 x 10K DNA bases (multiply by 2 because double-helix). Such a square lati
