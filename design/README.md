DNA nanotechnology is concerned with manufacturing nano-scale shapes and devices with DNA as the primary materials, see references below for background. 

This Java code is used to automatically generate the required oligonucleotides sequences (to be submitted to a synthetic DNA vendor for example) required to create a certain nanoscale shape. This works by 1) supplying the full lattice sequence (~10,000 DNA bases ~= 100x100 nanometer square lattice) which should could either be (a) the sequence of a long ssDNA scaffold (such as M13 viral DNA sequence) or (b) a long ssDNA synthetic sequences that has been software-generated/optimized; (2) defining the coordinates on this lattices; such coordinates can be as simple as [0,n] where n is the the horizental length of the lattice, which will produce a square shape, or more intricate coordinates that define a more elaborate shape (say, a smiley; see example of coordinates under input/ directory). The output is a list of "haps" (horizental oligos), "bridges" (vertical oligos), "staples" (used to splint-ligate haps or bridges into long ssDNA sequences), and horizental and vertical "primers" used to PCR-amplify splint-ligated haps and bridges. It is these long PCR-amplified DNA strands that are then annealed to produced the desired shapes. 

If you are confused, please see ref. for details on this protocol; if you're completely lost please read all the references below for background on DNA nano-fabrication generally.
